Since we used Firebase for our database and our frontend has not been fully integrated with Firebase yet, 
we decided to test our queries using an open source tool called Firestation. Firestation returns a graphical
query result within the application for queries that search for something. The query result screenshots are 
labeled in order they are listed in test-production.sql. They include screenshots from Firestation and from
the Firebase database itself for data insertions.
